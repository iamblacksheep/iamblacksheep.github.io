				<h1>The Beginning</h1>
				<p>They say everyone is good at something. Good at cooking? Talented Musician? Professional Teacher? or an Expert?</p>
				<p>Well, in this site. I would like to take a glance on what the world has to offer, what the internet has to offer. By the means of discovering what they have to offer. I would like to answer the question on what is a person good at. What is his talent, his expertise or his <i>savvy-ness</i>.</p>
				<p>Through this project, maybe I could find what I'm really good at. What makes me wake up every morning and keeps me up at night like not wanting to sleep it off. What's my passion?</p>
				<p>We all need to seek our passion, or else we would be living an unfulfilled life ahead of us. Now, do you ever ask the question: <b>What is my passion in life? What am I good at?</b>
